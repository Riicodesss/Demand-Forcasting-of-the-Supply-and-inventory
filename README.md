### 🎯 Problem Statement

Due to fluctuating milk supply, variable product demand, frequent changes in SKUs, and equipment downtime, Flavi Dairy's production and storage facilities are underutilized. This leads to:

- Underperformance of processing and packaging units
- Increased production and storage costs
- Losses due to overstocking or understocking
- Poor ROI on fixed capital assets
